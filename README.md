# BallVoyage
A runner game where you are a ball dodging square obstacles on their way home!

### Accomplishments
This project was the first time I worked with 3D elements in Unity! I did find it challenging at first to move objects and reference them while taking into account for a whole other axis but I was able to make the ball move correctly using physics elements in Unity so that it wouldn't separate from the floor. I am also very proud of creating my first scripts to move 3D objects/characters and being able to move the element with input from the keyboard using the arrow keys. This was also my first time working with collisions and I was able to use collisions to move the game scenes to either a death or win scene.

### What I would improve on in the future
I want to take this game further by adding moving obstacles to the game. As of right now, the obstacles are stationery, but I want to add an element where they move from left to right or up and down. I also would like to improve the graphics of the game and I would want to replace the ball with a 3D creature or person similarly to games like temple run. If I were to change the main character itself, I would want to practice animations so that there would be a real running motion rather than the physics-based motion of the current ball.
